# Initiative Tracker app: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Initiative Tracker app. This is an open source Android app developed by Sebastian Lehrbaum. The source code is available on GitHub.

# Data collected by the app
I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

There is the option to connect to a backend server which can be hosted by yourself. I have no access to your self-hosted instance of the server or any data
sent to it.
